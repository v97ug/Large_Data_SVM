Not to worried if Apple accepts our maps for iOS. It will be their loss if they don't and android will continue to be chosen over the iphone
Should Google jump into the wireless carrier business? It could be a good revenue source for us.
@Plaid_Cook Are you ready to view our new Maps app for the iOS?
Losing money is never fun but atleast we have the FTC off our backs now.
